🏏 IPL Match Data Analysis (2008–2024)

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Indian Premier League (IPL) match data from 2008 to 2024, consisting of 1095 matches and 20 features.
The aim is to transform raw match data into meaningful insights through systematic data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and statistical exploration.

The analysis focuses on uncovering:
	•	Historical performance of IPL teams
	•	Match distribution across seasons and cities
	•	Venue-wise hosting trends
	•	Toss impact on match outcomes
	•	Growth pattern of the IPL over the years

By leveraging Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, this project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow — from handling missing values and feature transformations to generating visual insights and storytelling with data.

This project also lays the foundation for future extensions such as:
	•	Player-level performance analysis
	•	Predictive modeling for match outcomes
	•	Interactive dashboards
	•	Machine learning applications after further coursework
